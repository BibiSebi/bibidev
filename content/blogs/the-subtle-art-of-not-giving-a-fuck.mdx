# Summary: The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck

The Book in Three Sentences: 

## Chapter 1: Donâ€˜t Try
- Accept the way you are. Positive affirmations show people what they are lacking and are therefore not as good for the mental health as thought.
- The goal in life is about giving less f*ck about more. 
- "#1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different." 
- With **different** Mark refers to being different than the today's standard. Accepting pain instead of wanting to change it.
- "#2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity."
- "#3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about."

## Chapter 2: Happiness Is a Problem
- The gaol is not to avoid problems but to solve them. There is never an end, fixing one problem creates another one, this Mark describes as the purpose and the beauty of life. 
- "Emotions are a part of the equation of our life but they are not the entire equation." 
- " What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?"
