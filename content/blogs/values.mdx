# Embracing the Power of Values

As I read some books and articles on management and personal
growth, one recurring theme that captured my attention
was the significance of defining one's values. This
exploration led me to question my own values. Initially
I just stood there blank, not knowing what my values were.
Consequently, I've decided to document them here as a
constant reminder of the principles that guide my life.
It's important to note that values can change over
time, even if only slightly, making this article a
perpetual work in progress.

## Work-Related Values:

1. **Commitment to Quality:** For me, quality translates
to producing code that is both comprehensible and
adaptable. In essence, it's about creating clean code.
However, quality encompasses more than just
clarityâ€”it extends to aspects like automated
testing and robust architecture.

2. **Open-Mindedness:** Another fundamental value of
mine is being open to alternative ideas.
Avoiding a dogmatic approach and believing in the
existence of only one correct method is crucial.
I strive to embrace diverse perspectives, seeking the
optimal path to implementing my code. I acknowledge
my human limitations and the impossibility of
considering every minor edge case.

3. **Feedback-Oriented:** Embracing this value can be
challenging, as I sometimes neglect it. However,
I recognize its importance. Having evidence that what
I am building or doing is on the right track is
invaluable. Mistakes are inevitable, but they become
learning opportunities only when acknowledged.
This value drives my efficiency, as I can pinpoint
where to focus my efforts, rather than expending
energy on fruitless endeavors.

## Personal Values:

While the following values are applicable to my
professional life, I choose to address them
separately for clarity.

1. **Empathy:** The ability to empathize with others
aligns perfectly with the value of being
feedback-driven. Ultimately, every aspect of our
lives is interconnected with someone else's.

2. **Honesty:** This value extends beyond honesty
in interactions with others; it encompasses
self-honesty as well. Being truthful with oneself
is as vital as being truthful with others.

3. **Authenticity:** Being true to myself is first of all why
I even started this collection.
So it only makes sense to mention it here. There were
some situations where I made a decision that left me unsatisfied and
I did not understand why. Only after reading some articles
and books I understood that I went against what I value.
Therefore, I believe having a list of values is a great tool to check against my authenticity.
